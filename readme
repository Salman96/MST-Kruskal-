1.Algorithm for MST used is Kruskal.
2.Implemented in graph.h and graph.cpp.
3.A sample input file named as “input.txt” is given in the folder. The format should follow this file where under “Nodes” heading each node is declared. For example “A 1 1” represents that there is a node with name A, x-cor 1 and y-cor 1. Then under “Arcs” each edge is declared. So, for example, “A B 7” represents an undirected edge between A and B with distance 7.
4.Run the main.cpp file and type in your text file to obtain its MST(in this case “input.txt”).
5.Enjoy.
